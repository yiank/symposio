# symposio
SYMPOSIO is an art-driven technology experiment that aims to enhance our dining experience and promote healthier eating habits by reducing automatic or mindless eating with the use of light and AI. The system continuously analyses the audio environment at the table using AI, dynamically adjusting the intensity and colour temperature of the lights. Additionally, it generates light signals tailored to encourage either eating or conversation, following predefined scenarios.
